// Consider a big party where N guests came to it and a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times was maintained.
// Find the minimum time at which there were maximum guests at the party. Note that entries in the register are not in any order.
// Input:
// Entry= {1, 2, 10, 5, 5}
// Exit = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}
// Output: 3 5
//Explanation: At time 5 there were guest number 2, 4 and 5 present.
